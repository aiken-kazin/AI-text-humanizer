Molecular biology is about how parts of cells like DNA, RNA, proteins, and other biomolecules interact with each other. Cellular biology is more about the structure and function of cells because they are the basic units of life. Inside cells, there are organelles such as mitochondria, chloroplasts, and nucleus that show special roles for making energy, doing photosynthesis, and controlling genes. Processes like mitosis and meiosis are very important for growing, reproducing, and passing on traits to next generations. Also cell signaling helps in coordination between many cells in multicellular organisms.\n"
